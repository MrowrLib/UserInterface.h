-- Features of v3:
--
-- Can create widgets BEFORE they get attached
-- to implementation classes.
--
-- So you can easily configure things beforehand.'
--
-- Also, it's Fluent, so you can chain things together.
-- e.g. button->set_text("Hello")->set_color(RED);
--
-- Use Apply() to apply the settings to the widget.
-- This is done automatically when the widget is attached.
--
-- TODO: look at FLTK on Mac and Linux after grid is OK!
--
-- And there's a Default Implementation for stuff!
